So SpringBoot helps create micro services and APIS. What if the default gateway (/) is to the API.
Then we could access the API from the mobile app through the default gateway, then have a separate route
mapped to the website (lets say /web/) that is the web app. Then the web app and the mobile app would be using
the API as the backend. This seems like the right way to do it, but I am not sure how to set it up with maven
and/or SpringBoot
