# CampusMarket

## Project Description

My team members (3) and I created an Android app that represents a marketplace for college students to buy and sell any items they want such as textbooks, technology, etc. Our original idea was a campus rental system for cars, but we decided to expand it so the app is more general purpose. For the server-side, we used the SpringBoot framework and MySQL as our database.  The app was chosen as one of the best projects in the class ( 6 teams were chosen out of 78 teams).
