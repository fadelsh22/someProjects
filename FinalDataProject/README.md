## Project
A data visualization project to examine whether or not latitude has any effect in the spread of COVID-19. The comparison is mainly between different provinces/states in China & Canada. We modeled the data using the  k-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm (kNN). 

Note: The source of the data is Johns Hopkins University. The project was finished in late April, so our data was only up to March 22nd. Our conclusion is only based on this data which was recent at the time. We antipicate that a lot has changed since then, and our conclusion may be change with more up- to-date data.

## Languages

1- Python (jupyter notebook)



## Results

There is no correlation between the spread of COVID-19 & latitude.
