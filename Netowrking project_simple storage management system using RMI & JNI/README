Project 3 COMS 487

Agent code is in Java
Manager code is in Java

GetLocalTime & GetLocalOS are in C++ (using JNI)

All required functionalities are implemented and working (same functionalities as in hw1 but using RMI & JNI instead).

NOTE: This only works in Mac. I was not able to make the rmiregistry work in pyrite (due to some proxy reasons it seems) so please run in a Mac machine for testing it. I have attached a demo video of me running it in my laptop and showing how it works.

To run the program:
Please see the youtube video(only people with the link can see it) that I made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fau4SDZe1MQ


Please ask for clarification if needed. 

Thank you!!
Fadel
