# Conclusion

## How does it all work?

In short, the backend communicates with our MongoDB database to get the data \(e.g., news, prices, etc.\), then the data gets streamed to Telegram through the micro-service Kafka. We use several APIs to obtain the data. 

In the future, we intend to implement a similar alert bot for Slack! For more infromation or questions,  please visit our [homepage](https://www.bitcurate.com) for contact.
